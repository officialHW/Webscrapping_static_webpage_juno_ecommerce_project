**Title: Juno Ecommerce Market Analysis with Web Scraping (by officialHW)**

**Project Description:**

This project explores the use of web scraping to gather market insights for Juno Ecommerce, a prominent vendor on Jumia. The focus is on HP laptops specifically, aiming to help Juno make informed decisions regarding their Jumia strategy. This project is for educational purposes only and does not intend to violate Jumia's terms of service.

**Ethical Considerations**:
Ethical web scraping practices were a priority during this project's development. The code adheres to best practices by respecting potential rate limits to avoid overwhelming Jumia's servers.

It's important to note that scraping data without permission can be unethical. It's recommended to explore alternative data sources, such as APIs or partnerships with Jumia, if scraping is not allowed.

**Technical Overview:**

This project implements an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to collect and analyze HP laptop data from Jumia. Here are the key libraries used:

BeautifulSoup4 (for parsing HTML structure of Jumia's website) (Documentation)
requests (for making HTTP requests to Jumia's web pages) (Documentation)
pandas (for data manipulation and analysis) (Documentation)
SQLAlchemy (for database interaction if you choose to store the data in this case I did.)

**Data Extraction:**

In this case the targets HP laptop listings on Jumia.
Extracted data points include:
- Product names
- Sales prices
- Original prices (if available)
- Discount percentages (if applicable)

**Data Transformation:**

Handles missing or null values (e.g., replacing non-sale item prices with 0).
Processes data from multiple pages (up to 50 for HP laptops in your example). This ensures capturing comprehensive data for analysis.

**Benefits for Juno Ecommerce:**

Real-time market insights on HP laptop offerings on Jumia. This provides Juno with a competitive edge by understanding current market trends.
Data-driven decisions for optimizing pricing, inventory management, and Jumia strategy. By analyzing scraped data, Juno can make informed decisions to improve their Jumia presence.
