**Title: Juno Ecommerce Market Analysis with Web Scraping (by officialHW)**

**Project Description:**

Juno Ecommerce, a prominent vendor on Jumia, has established itself as a
key player in the online retail market, offering a diverse range of products
across multiple categories. As the digital marketplace continues to evolve,
Juno faces the challenge of maintaining competitiveness and market
relevance amidst fluctuating consumer preferences and aggressive
competitor strategies. Recognizing the need to harness data for strategic
decision-making, Juno has embarked on an ambitious project to leverage
web scraping technologies for comprehensive market analysis. This
initiative aims to automate the extraction of vast amounts of product and
pricing information from Jumia, facilitating real-time market insights and
enabling data-driven strategies to optimize pricing, inventory management,
and customer engagement.


**BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In the dynamic and competitive landscape of e-commerce, Juno
Ecommerce's ability to stay ahead hinges on its capacity to quickly gather
and analyze market data. Traditionally, the process of collecting data on
product offerings, competitor pricing, and market trends has been manual,
time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies, leading to delayed responses to
market changes and opportunities. Furthermore, the volume and
complexity of data exceed the capability of manual processes to capture
and analyze effectively, resulting in missed insights and strategic
opportunities. Juno requires a systematic approach to data acquisition and
analysis that can scale with the rapid pace of the e-commerce environment.

**Technical Overview:**

This project implements an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to collect
and analyze HP laptop data from Jumia. Here are the key libraries used:

BeautifulSoup4 (for parsing HTML structure of Jumia's website) (Documentation)
requests (for making HTTP requests to Jumia's web pages) (Documentation)
pandas (for data manipulation and analysis) (Documentation)
SQLAlchemy (for database interaction if you choose to store the data in this case I did.)

**Data Extraction:**

In this case the targets HP laptop listings on Jumia.
Extracted data points include:
- Product names
- Sales prices
- Original prices (if available)
- Discount percentages (if applicable)

**Data Transformation:**

Handles missing or null values (e.g., replacing non-sale item prices with 0).
Processes data from multiple pages (up to 50 for HP laptops in your example). This ensures capturing comprehensive data for analysis.

It's important to be aware that not all websites allow web scraping. While web scraping can be a valuable tool for data collection and analysis, it's crucial to respect website terms of service and legal restrictions.
